# Interactive Animation Project Report

## ABSTRACT

Computer graphics has revolutionized the way we visualize and interact with digital content. This project demonstrates the power of interactive computer graphics through an engaging animation system built using OpenGL. The project showcases various animated scenes including rain effects, flying birds, moving vehicles, and dynamic weather transitions.

The animation system features multiple interactive scenes that can be triggered through keyboard inputs, demonstrating fundamental computer graphics concepts like:
- Real-time animation and motion
- User interaction and input handling
- Scene management and transitions
- Weather effects and particle systems
- Object-oriented graphics programming

The project serves as both an educational tool for understanding computer graphics principles and an entertaining demonstration of interactive animation capabilities.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

Computer graphics has become an essential part of modern computing, enabling us to create and manipulate visual content in ways that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. This project explores the realm of interactive computer graphics through the implementation of an animated scene system using OpenGL.

The project features multiple interactive scenes that demonstrate various aspects of computer graphics:
- Dynamic weather effects including rain and clouds
- Animated characters and objects
- Day/night transitions
- Interactive user controls
- Real-time animation

The scenes are designed to be both visually appealing and educational, showcasing fundamental computer graphics concepts while providing an engaging user experience.

### 1.1 Project Overview

The interactive animation system consists of several key components:

1. Scene Management System
   - Multiple scene states (1-9 for number scenes, a,e,i,o,u,r for letter scenes)
   - Smooth transitions between scenes
   - State-based animation control

2. Weather System
   - Rain simulation with particle effects
   - Cloud movement and animation
   - Day/night cycle with dynamic lighting

3. Character Animation System
   - Birds with wing flapping
   - Fish with tail movement
   - Butterflies with wing animation
   - Cars with wheel rotation

4. Interactive Controls
   - Keyboard input for scene selection
   - Animation control (start/stop)
   - Color modification options

## Chapter 2: Literature Survey

### 2.1 Interactive and Non-Interactive Graphics

Computer graphics can be broadly classified into two categories:

#### 2.1.1 Non-Interactive Graphics
- Also known as passive graphics
- Observer has no control over the displayed content
- Content is pre-rendered and static
- Examples: Movies, pre-rendered animations

#### 2.1.2 Interactive Graphics
- Two-way communication between user and computer
- Real-time response to user input
- Dynamic content updates
- Examples: Video games, interactive applications

### 2.2 About OpenGL

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-platform, cross-language API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. Key features include:
- Hardware-accelerated rendering
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Extensive feature set
- Large developer community
- Well-documented API
