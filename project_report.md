# Interactive Animation Project Report

## ABSTRACT

Computer graphics has revolutionized the way we visualize and interact with digital content. This project demonstrates the power of interactive computer graphics through an engaging animation system built using OpenGL. The project showcases various animated scenes including rain effects, flying birds, moving vehicles, and dynamic weather transitions.

The animation system features multiple interactive scenes that can be triggered through keyboard inputs, demonstrating fundamental computer graphics concepts like:
- Real-time animation and motion
- User interaction and input handling
- Scene management and transitions
- Weather effects and particle systems
- Object-oriented graphics programming

The project serves as both an educational tool for understanding computer graphics principles and an entertaining demonstration of interactive animation capabilities.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENT

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all those who contributed to the successful completion of this project.

First and foremost, I thank my professors and mentors for their guidance and support throughout the development process. Their expertise in computer graphics and OpenGL programming was invaluable.

I am grateful to the open-source community for providing excellent documentation and resources on OpenGL and computer graphics programming.

Special thanks to my family and friends for their encouragement and understanding during the long hours spent on this project.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

Computer graphics has become an essential part of modern computing, enabling us to create and manipulate visual content in ways that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. This project explores the realm of interactive computer graphics through the implementation of an animated scene system using OpenGL.

The project features multiple interactive scenes that demonstrate various aspects of computer graphics:
- Dynamic weather effects including rain and clouds
- Animated characters and objects
- Day/night transitions
- Interactive user controls
- Real-time animation

The scenes are designed to be both visually appealing and educational, showcasing fundamental computer graphics concepts while providing an engaging user experience.

## Chapter 2: Literature Survey

### 2.1 Interactive and Non-Interactive Graphics

Computer graphics can be broadly classified into two categories:

#### 2.1.1 Non-Interactive Graphics
- Also known as passive graphics
- Observer has no control over the displayed content
- Content is pre-rendered and static
- Examples: Movies, pre-rendered animations

#### 2.1.2 Interactive Graphics
- Two-way communication between user and computer
- Real-time response to user input
- Dynamic content updates
- Examples: Video games, interactive applications
